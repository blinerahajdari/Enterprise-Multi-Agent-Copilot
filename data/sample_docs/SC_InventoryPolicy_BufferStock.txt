Inventory Policy — Buffer Stock (Synthetic)
Priority SKUs (A, B):
- Target service level: 95%
- Safety stock guideline: cover 1.5× (lead time std dev in days) + 0.5× forecast error window.
- Reorder point is reviewed monthly; add temporary buffers during high-risk lanes (e.g., East Coast port congestion).
